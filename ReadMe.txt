Three files are contained in this folder:

1) KnightsTour.xlsm - This is the main application built and tested in Excel 2010.
2) Alpha.ttf - This is the TypeType Chess Alpha font by Eric Bentzen.
3) Alpha.rtf - This is support notes for the Chess Alpha font.

The Excel workbook when opened, will automatically install the font on your machine and then
uninstall the font when closed down.

If you have any reservations about this, disable macros when you open the workbook. This will allow you to
at least view the code.

Without the font installed the program should still run, however it won't look like any of the screenshots/video
that you might have seen of the application in action.
